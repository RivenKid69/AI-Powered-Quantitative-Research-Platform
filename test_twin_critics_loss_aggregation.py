"""
Verification script for Twin Critics loss aggregation issue.

Problem: Current implementation averages losses BEFORE applying max(L_uc, L_c),
but mathematically correct approach should apply max to EACH critic independently.

Current: max((L_uc1 + L_uc2)/2, (L_c1 + L_c2)/2)
Correct: (max(L_uc1, L_c1) + max(L_uc2, L_c2))/2

This script tests whether these formulas are equivalent.
