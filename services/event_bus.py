"""Asynchronous in-memory event bus with backpressure handling.

The bus maintains a bounded queue of events.  When the queue is full new
events are dropped according to ``drop_policy``:

``"oldest"``  – remove the oldest queued event and enqueue the new one.

``"newest"``  – drop the incoming event.

Simple Prometheus metrics are emitted via :mod:`services.monitoring`:

``queue_depth`` -- current queue size

``events_in`` -- total number of events accepted into the queue

``dropped_bp`` -- events dropped because of backpressure
