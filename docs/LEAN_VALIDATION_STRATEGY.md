# Lean Validation Strategy

*Customer-First Approach to Market Entry*

---

## Executive Summary

We have built a robust technical foundation. **Now we validate.**

This document outlines our customer-centric approach to market validation, following lean startup principles. Our strategy: deploy the minimum viable product to a focused customer segment, gather feedback rapidly, and iterate based on real-world usage — not assumptions.

**Core Principle**: Technical excellence is an asset, not a destination. The next phase is about proving product-market fit through validated learning.

## Phase 1: Customer Discovery (Current)

### Target Customer Segment

**Primary**: European proprietary trading firms (5-50 traders)

| Characteristic | Criteria |
|----------------|----------|
| **Size** | 5-50 traders |
| **Location** | EU (Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, France) |
| **Trading Style** | Quantitative/systematic |
| **Current Pain** | 6-12 month infrastructure build time |
| **Budget Authority** | CTO or Head of Technology |

### Discovery Activities

| Activity | Timeline | Deliverable |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Customer interviews (20+) | Weeks 1-4 | Pain point validation |
| Problem hypothesis testing | Weeks 2-4 | Ranked problem list |
| Solution concept testing | Weeks 3-6 | Feature priority matrix |
| Pricing sensitivity analysis | Weeks 4-6 | Willingness-to-pay data |

### Key Hypotheses to Validate

1. **Problem Hypothesis**: Prop trading firms spend 6-12 months building infrastructure before deploying their first strategy
2. **Solution Hypothesis**: A pre-built, risk-aware execution platform reduces time-to-market significantly
3. **Value Hypothesis**: Firms will pay €2,000-5,000/month for this capability
4. **Growth Hypothesis**: Satisfied customers will refer other firms

## Phase 2: MVP Definition

### What We're NOT Launching First

The platform supports 5 asset classes and numerous features. **For initial validation, we deliberately constrain scope:**

| Feature | Status | Rationale |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Options pricing & Greeks | Deferred | Complex, requires specialized users |
| CME futures integration | Deferred | Regulatory complexity for EU |
| L3 LOB simulation | Deferred | Advanced feature, not MVP-critical |
| PBT/adversarial training | Deferred | Research feature, not customer-facing |

### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1 Pilot)

| Feature | Priority | Customer Value |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| Crypto spot/futures execution | P0 | Core trading capability |
| Risk-aware position sizing | P0 | Key differentiator |
| Basic backtesting | P0 | Strategy validation |
| Real-time monitoring | P0 | Operational necessity |
| Configurable risk limits | P1 | Compliance requirement |
| Performance reporting | P1 | Business intelligence |

**MVP Criterion**: Only features that solve the core problem (fast time-to-market for quantitative strategies) make the initial release.

---

## Phase 3: Pilot Program Design

### Pilot Structure

**Cohort 1**: 3-5 European prop trading firms

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Duration | 3 months |
| Pricing | Free or deeply discounted (€500/month) |
| Commitment | Weekly feedback sessions, usage data sharing |
| Support | Dedicated Slack channel, weekly calls |
| Exit criteria | Usage metrics, NPS score, conversion intent |

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Activation** | 80% complete onboarding | Setup completion rate |
| **Engagement** | 3+ strategies deployed | Feature usage |
| **Retention** | 70% active at month 3 | Weekly active users |
| **Satisfaction** | NPS > 40 | Monthly survey |
| **Conversion** | 50% willing to pay | Exit interview |

**Reference**: Ellis, S. (2017). *Hacking Growth*. Crown Business.

## Phase 4: Iteration Protocol

### Weekly Review Cadence

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Monday | Usage metrics review |
| Tuesday | Customer feedback synthesis |
| Wednesday | Prioritization meeting |
| Thursday-Friday | Implementation sprint |
| Friday | Pilot customer update |

### Feature Request Triage

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  FEATURE REQUEST FLOW                        │
│                                                              │
│  Request ──► [Frequency?] ──► [Aligns with MVP?] ──► Build  │
│      │           │                    │                      │
│      │           ▼                    ▼                      │
│      │      Low (1-2)           No alignment                │
│      │           │                    │                      │
│      │           ▼                    ▼                      │
│      │        Log it              Backlog                   │
│      │                                                       │
│      ▼                                                       │
│  Single request ──► Acknowledge, defer                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Pivot Criteria

We will consider pivoting if after 3 months:
- Activation rate < 50%
- NPS < 0
- Zero conversion intent
- Consistent feedback that core value proposition is wrong

## Go-to-Market: European Focus

### Why Europe First

| Factor | Europe | US |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Regulatory clarity | MiFID II framework | Fragmented state laws |
| Competition density | Lower | Saturated |
| Visa pathway | Startup visa programs | Complex immigration |
| Market size | €2B+ algorithmic trading | Larger but more competitive |
| Language | English widely spoken | English native |

### Target Markets (Prioritized)

1. **Netherlands** — Amsterdam trading hub, English-friendly, startup visa
2. **Germany** — Frankfurt financial center, BaFin-regulated firms
3. **Ireland** — Dublin fintech cluster, EU passporting
4. **France** — Paris quant community, French Tech Visa

### Customer Acquisition Strategy

| Channel | Cost | Timeline | Expected Leads |
|---------|------|----------|----------------|
| LinkedIn outreach | Low | Immediate | 10-20/month |
| Trading conferences | Medium | 2-3 months | 5-10/event |
| Content marketing | Low | 3-6 months | Organic growth |
| Partner referrals | Low | 3+ months | 2-5/month |

---

## Investment in Validation, Not Features

### Resource Allocation (Next 6 Months)

| Area | Allocation | Focus |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Customer Development** | 40% | Interviews, pilots, feedback loops |
| **Product Iteration** | 30% | MVP refinement based on feedback |
| **Sales & Marketing** | 20% | European market penetration |
| **New Features** | 10% | Only if validated by customer demand |

### What We Will NOT Do

- Add new asset classes until current ones are validated
- Build features without customer requests (minimum 3 firms asking)
- Expand geographically until EU product-market fit is proven
- Hire engineers before revenue validates demand

**Reference**: Maurya, A. (2012). *Running Lean*. O'Reilly Media.

## Validation Milestones

### 6-Month Roadmap

| Month | Milestone | Success Criteria |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| **1** | Complete 20 customer interviews | Pain point ranking validated |
| **2** | Launch pilot with 3 firms | Onboarding complete |
| **3** | First usage metrics | 80% activation |
| **4** | Feature iteration cycle | Top 3 requests addressed |
| **5** | Expansion to 5-7 pilot firms | Referral from existing pilots |
| **6** | Conversion discussions | 50%+ express payment intent |

### Investment Readiness Criteria

Before seeking significant funding, we will demonstrate:

| Criterion | Evidence Required |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Problem validation | 20+ customer interviews confirming pain |
| Solution validation | 5+ firms actively using product |
| Willingness to pay | 3+ firms converted to paid |
| Scalable acquisition | Repeatable channel identified |
| Unit economics | CAC and LTV estimated |

## Technical Foundation as Asset

### Why Our Technical Depth is an Advantage (Not Over-Engineering)

1. **Reduced Iteration Risk**: Solid architecture allows fast feature changes without breaking production
2. **Credibility with Technical Buyers**: CTOs of prop firms evaluate technical quality
3. **Defensibility**: 11,000+ tests and 2+ years of development create barrier to entry
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: MiFID II requires robust risk management — we have it

### Reframing the Narrative

| Old Framing | New Framing |
|-------------|-------------|
| "11,000+ automated tests" | "Production-ready from day one — no beta quality issues" |
| "2+ years development" | "Battle-tested architecture ready for customer feedback" |
| "5 asset classes" | "Crypto-focused MVP with proven extensibility" |
| "7+ academic papers" | "Research-backed risk management that regulators trust" |

## Communication to Investors

### Key Messages

1. **We built the foundation. Now we validate.**
   - Technical infrastructure complete
   - Next phase: customer discovery and iteration

2. **Disciplined scope management.**
   - MVP defined and constrained
   - Features gated by customer demand

3. **European market focus.**
   - Clear regulatory pathway
   - Less competitive than US
   - Startup visa alignment

4. **Metrics-driven decision making.**
   - Clear success criteria
   - Defined pivot triggers
   - Weekly iteration cycles

### FAQ for Investors

**Q: Why build so much before talking to customers?**
A: The core infrastructure (execution, risk management) requires significant upfront investment to be credible with institutional clients. We now have a working product to demonstrate — not a prototype or mockup.

**Q: How do you avoid continuing to build without validation?**
A: We have defined our MVP scope and committed to a feature freeze. New features require validation from 3+ pilot customers before development.

**Q: What if customers want different features?**
A: That's exactly what we want to learn. Our architecture supports rapid iteration. We'll build what customers pay for, not what we assume they need.
