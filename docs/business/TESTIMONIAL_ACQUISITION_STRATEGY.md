# Testimonial Acquisition Strategy

## Playbook for Building Social Proof & Customer Evidence

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** December 2025
**Classification:** Internal Strategy

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a **systematic approach** to acquiring customer testimonials, case studies, and social proof for QuantBot AI. The strategy addresses the critical gap of lacking confirmed customer references by establishing:

1. **Pilot-to-Testimonial Pipeline** — Converting pilot participants to advocates
2. **Tiered Evidence Program** — From quotes to full case studies
3. **Logo Acquisition Strategy** — Systematic approach to public references
4. **Measurement Framework** — KPIs and progress tracking

### Target Outcomes (12 months)

| Asset Type | Current | Target | Timeline |
|------------|---------|--------|----------|
| Written Testimonials | 0 | 10+ | 6 months |
| Video Testimonials | 0 | 3+ | 9 months |
| Full Case Studies | 0 | 4+ | 12 months |
| Public Logo References | 0 | 5+ | 6 months |
| G2/Capterra Reviews | 0 | 15+ | 9 months |

---

## 1. The Social Proof Gap Analysis

### 1.1 Current State

**Available Evidence:**
- Technical documentation (comprehensive)
- Research-backed projections (theoretical)
- Competitive analysis (indirect)

**Missing Evidence:**
- Named customer testimonials
- Quantified results ("saved X months," "improved Sharpe by Y")
- Public logo references
- Third-party reviews
- Video testimonials
- Industry awards

### 1.2 Impact of Missing Social Proof

Per **Nielsen** and **Demand Gen** research:

> - **92%** of B2B buyers are more likely to purchase after reading trusted reviews
> - **70%** of B2B buyers view 3+ pieces of content before engaging sales
> - **Case studies are the #1 most effective content type** in B2B sales (Demand Gen 2023)

### 1.3 Competitive Disadvantage

| Competitor | Testimonials | Case Studies | Reviews |
|------------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| QuantConnect | 50+ quotes | 10+ | 200+ (G2) |
| Alpaca | 100+ quotes | 20+ | 150+ |
| **QuantBot (Current)** | **0** | **0** | **0** |

---

## 2. Pilot-to-Testimonial Pipeline

### 2.1 Pilot Program Integration

The [European Pilot Program](../PILOT_PROGRAM.md) is designed to convert participants to advocates:

```
Week 0-4: Onboarding & Setup
    ↓
Week 5-8: Active Usage (track success metrics)
    ↓
Week 9-11: Optimization (capture improvements)
    ↓
Week 12: Exit Interview
    ↓
Testimonial Request (within 2 weeks of positive exit)
    ↓
Case Study Invitation (for top performers)
    ↓
Reference Program Enrollment
```

### 2.2 Success Metric Tracking

**Track throughout pilot for testimonial content:**

| Metric | Measurement | Testimonial Use |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Time to first live trade | Days from signup | "Deployed in 4 days vs. 3-month estimate" |
| Strategies deployed | Count | "Running 5 strategies in parallel" |
| Backtests run | Count | "Tested 200+ parameter combinations" |
| Risk features used | % adoption | "CVaR limits caught 3 potential drawdowns" |
| Support interactions | Count & resolution time | "Issues resolved in under 2 hours" |
| NPS score | 1-10 + comment | Direct quote for testimonial |

### 2.3 Testimonial Request Timing

**Optimal Windows:**

| Trigger Event | Timing | Approach |
|---------------|--------|----------|
| First live profit | Immediately | Quick quote request (email) |
| Successful backtest | Same day | Feature-specific quote |
| Problem resolution | 24 hours | Support experience quote |
| Month 3 (pilot end) | Exit interview | Formal testimonial request |
| Conversion to paid | Week 2 post-conversion | Comprehensive testimonial |
| 6-month anniversary | Proactive outreach | Updated testimonial |

### 2.4 Request Templates

**Quick Quote Request (Email):**

```
Subject: Quick favor — share your experience?

Hi [Name],

I noticed you just [deployed your first strategy / achieved X].
Congratulations!

Would you mind sharing a quick 1-2 sentence quote about your
experience with QuantBot? It would really help other [prop traders /
quant teams] understand the value.

Something like:
"QuantBot helped us [specific outcome]. I especially appreciated
[feature/benefit]."

[Your name]

P.S. I can send a draft for your approval if that's easier.
```

**Formal Testimonial Request (Post-Pilot):**

```
Subject: Would you share your QuantBot story?

Hi [Name],

First, thank you for being part of our pilot program. Your feedback

feature your experience in our customer testimonials. This would
include:

> ML pipeline and risk management, we deployed our first strategy in
> under two weeks instead of the 6 months we had budgeted. We've
> since launched three additional strategies and our Sharpe ratio
