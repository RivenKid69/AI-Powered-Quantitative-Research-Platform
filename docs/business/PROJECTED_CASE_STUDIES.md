#### ROI Calculation

```
Investment (Year 1):
  - QuantBot Pro license: €12,000
  - Reduced quant salary (6 mo saved): Benefit
  - Infrastructure savings: Benefit

Benefits (Year 1):
  - Development cost savings: €197,500
  - Time-to-market value: €50,000 (earlier deployment on €5M)

3. Gartner "Application Modernization Cost Benchmarks" (2024)

#### Performance Enhancement Projection

| Metric | Current | Projected | Improvement | Basis |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Execution quality** | 45% arrival price | 60% arrival price | +33% | L3 LOB simulation |
| **Slippage reduction** | 8 bps avg | 4 bps avg | -50% | Almgren-Chriss calibration |
| **Strategy capacity** | 5 active strategies | 15+ strategies | +200% | ML automation |
| **Signal latency** | 500ms decision | 50ms decision | -90% | Optimized inference |

**Financial Impact (€2B book):**
- Slippage savings: 4 bps × €50B annual volume = **€20M/year**
- Improved execution: 15% × €20M = **€3M/year additional**
- Total execution improvement: **€23M/year**

**Research Reference:**
- Kissell & Glantz (2013). "Optimal Trading Strategies" - execution improvement worth 5-20 bps for institutional traders
- ITG "Global Cost Review 2023" - average institutional slippage: 8-12 bps

#### Risk-Adjusted Return Enhancement

Using industry-standard factors:

| Factor | Impact | Value (€2B book) |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Sharpe improvement (+0.2)** | Better risk-adjusted returns | €10-20M/year |
| **Drawdown reduction (30%)** | Capital efficiency | €15-30M capital freed |
| **Tail risk mitigation** | Lower VaR requirements | €50M capital reduction |

**Regulatory Capital Benefit:**
- Reduced VaR → Lower capital requirements
- At 8% capital ratio: €50M freed capital = €4M/year cost savings

### Enterprise ROI Summary

| Year | Investment | Benefits | Cumulative ROI |
|------|------------|----------|----------------|
| Y1 | €1.5M (license + integration) | €15M (execution + risk) | 900% |

**5-Year NPV (8% discount rate): €72M**

### Confidence Level

| Projection | Confidence | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------|
| Build vs buy savings | **High** | Well-researched industry benchmarks |
| Execution improvement | **Medium-High** | Strong theoretical basis |

## Projected Case Study 4: Independent Quant Researcher

### Scenario Profile

| Attribute | Value | Basis |
|-----------|-------|-------|

|-----------|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Strategy development** | 6-12 months | 2-4 months | 3-6x faster |
| **Backtest infrastructure** | 3-6 months | 1 week | 12-24x faster |
| **Paper trading validation** | 3-6 months | 1-2 months | 3x faster |
| **Live trading (small)** | 3-6 months | 1 month | 3-6x faster |
| **Track record (12 mo live)** | 24-36 months total | 15-18 months | **40-50%** faster |

**Value of Time Acceleration:**
- Earlier fundraising eligibility
- Reduced personal capital burn
- Faster iteration on strategy ideas

### Cost Comparison: Year 1

| Item | DIY Approach | With QuantBot | Savings |
|------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| **Cloud infrastructure** | €6,000 | Included | €6,000 |
| **Data feeds** | €12,000 | Included | €12,000 |
| **Development time** (opportunity cost) | €60,000 | €20,000 | €40,000 |
| **Backtest software** | €3,000 | Included | €3,000 |
| **Risk tools** | €2,000 | Included | €2,000 |
| **QuantBot Starter Pro** | - | €948 | (€948) |
| **Total** | **€83,000** | **€20,948** | **€62,052** |

### Path to Institutional Allocation

| Stage | Requirement | How QuantBot Helps |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Seed investors** | Compelling backtest | Professional-grade simulation |
| **Family offices** | 12-mo live track | Accelerated time-to-live |
| **Small institutions** | 24-mo track + risk mgmt | CVaR-aware performance |
| **Large allocators** | 36-mo track + audit trail | Full execution logs |

**Research Reference:** Cambridge Associates "Manager Selection Process" (2023) - Allocators require minimum 24-36 month track record, with emphasis on risk-adjusted returns.

### Projected Fundraising Impact

Assuming successful 18-month track record with 1.5 Sharpe:

| Fundraise Stage | Amount | Typical Timing | With QuantBot |
|-----------------|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Seed round** | €1-5M | Month 18-24 | Month 12-15 |
| **Series A** | €10-25M | Month 30-36 | Month 24-30 |
| **Series B** | €50-100M | Month 48-60 | Month 36-48 |

**Economic Value of 6-12 Month Acceleration:**
- Earlier management fees: €1M AUM × 2% = €20K/year × 1 year = €20K
- Earlier performance fees: €1M × 20% × 10% return = €20K
- **Acceleration value: €40K+ per €1M raised early**

### Confidence Level

| Projection | Confidence | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------|
| Time savings | **High** | Based on comparable platforms |
| Cost savings | **High** | Published pricing data |
| Fundraising acceleration | **Medium** | Many external factors |
