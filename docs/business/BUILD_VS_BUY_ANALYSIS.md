## 1. Cost Analysis Framework

### 1.1 Build Cost Components (COCOMO II Methodology)

Using **COCOMO II** (Constructive Cost Model) from Boehm et al. (2000), we estimate development costs for equivalent trading infrastructure.

**Base Formula:**
```
Effort (person-months) = 2.94 × (KLOC)^1.0997 × Π(Effort Multipliers)
```

**QuantBot Equivalent System:**
- **Core ML Engine:** ~15 KLOC (Python)
- **Execution Simulation:** ~12 KLOC
- **Risk Management:** ~8 KLOC
- **Data Pipeline:** ~5 KLOC
- **Exchange Adapters:** ~10 KLOC
- **Testing & Validation:** ~12 KLOC (597 test files, 11,063 tests)
- **Total:** ~62 KLOC

**COCOMO II Calculation:**
```
Effort = 2.94 × 62^1.0997 × 1.2 (complexity multiplier)
       = 2.94 × 85.7 × 1.2
       = ~302 person-months
```

## 2. Ongoing Maintenance Costs

### 2.1 Industry Benchmark: Maintenance Ratio

Per Gartner (2023) and IEEE Software Maintenance studies:

> **Software maintenance typically costs 40-60% of initial development cost annually**

For trading systems specifically, maintenance is higher due to:
- Exchange API changes (2-4 per exchange per year)
- Regulatory updates (MiCA, ESMA guidelines)
- Market microstructure evolution
- ML model retraining requirements

### 2.2 Build: Annual Maintenance Cost

| Activity | FTE | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|----------|-----|--------------|-------------|
| Bug fixes & patches | 0.5 | €5,000 | €60,000 |
| Exchange API updates | 0.3 | €3,000 | €36,000 |
| Security updates | 0.2 | €2,000 | €24,000 |
| Feature enhancements | 0.5 | €5,000 | €60,000 |
| ML model retraining | 0.3 | €3,600 | €43,200 |
| Infrastructure | 0.2 | €2,000 | €24,000 |
| **Total Maintenance** | **2.0** | | **€247,200/year** |

**Maintenance Ratio:** €247,200 / €1,609,200 = **15.4%** (conservative; industry average 40-60%)

## 7. Strategic Considerations

### 7.1 Core Competency Alignment

| Firm Type | Trading Infrastructure | Core Competency? | Recommendation |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Prop Trading Firm | Strategy execution | **No** | Buy |
| Systematic Hedge Fund | Alpha generation | **No** | Buy |
| Bank Trading Desk | Client flow | **No** | Buy |
| Technology Vendor | Platform itself | **Yes** | Build |
| Quant Research Lab | Research tools | **Partial** | Buy + Customize |

**Framework:** Per Clayton Christensen's theory, outsource non-core activities to specialists.

### 7.2 Build When...

- You ARE a technology company (infrastructure is your product)
- You have €10M+ budget AND 3+ years timeline
- Your requirements are genuinely unique (institutional-scale, custom asset classes)
- You have an established quant engineering team (10+ developers)
- Competitive differentiation requires full control

### 7.3 Buy When...

- Core competency is trading/investment, not software
- Time-to-market is critical (alpha decay, market opportunity)
- Budget is < €5M for infrastructure
- Team is < 10 quant developers
- You want predictable costs and ongoing innovation

## Appendix A: TCO Calculator

### Quick TCO Estimation Formula

**Build Cost:**
```
Build_TCO = (Team_Size × Avg_Salary × Months) × 1.25 + (Months / 12) × Maintenance_Rate × Build_Cost
```

**Buy Cost:**
```
Buy_TCO = (Annual_Subscription × Years) + Onboarding_Fee
```

**Example (5-year, Team tier):**
```
Build: (7 × €9,000 × 24) × 1.25 + (60/12) × 0.15 × €1.89M = €3.08M
Buy:   (€60,000 × 5) + €5,000 = €305K
```
