# Pricing Differentiation Strategy

## QuantBot AI - Segment-Based Pricing Framework

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** December 2025
**Classification:** Internal Strategy Document

---

## Executive Summary

This document establishes a **comprehensive pricing differentiation strategy** for QuantBot AI, addressing the critical weakness of one-size-fits-all pricing. Our framework is built on:

- **Value-based pricing principles** (Pearson Ham Group methodology)
- **Multi-metric pricing** aligned with fintech best practices (McKinsey research: 40% more market share)
- **Segment-specific packaging** for three distinct customer profiles
- **Clear upgrade paths** to maximize customer lifetime value

**Key Reference:** According to [SBI Growth's 2024 State of B2B SaaS Pricing](https://sbigrowth.com/tools-and-solutions/pricing-benchmarks-report-2024), financial SaaS companies using 3-4 pricing metrics capture significantly more value than those using 1-2 metrics.

## 1. Customer Segmentation Framework

### 1.1 Target Segments

Based on industry analysis of quantitative trading market structure ([QuantBlueprint](https://www.quantblueprint.com/post/top-quant-firms-list-comp-up-to-500k), [WallStreetQuants](https://www.thewallstreetquants.com/firm-list)):

| Segment | AUM Range | Team Size | Decision Maker | Sales Motion |
|---------|-----------|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Indie/Small Prop** | $0-10M | 1-5 | Trader/Founder | Self-serve + PLG |
| **Mid-Size Fund** | $10M-500M | 5-50 | CTO/Head of Quant | Inside sales |
| **Enterprise/Bank** | $500M+ | 50-1000+ | C-Suite + Procurement | Field sales |

## 2. Pricing Model Architecture

### 2.1 Multi-Metric Pricing Framework

Per [Financial Services SaaS Pricing in 2024](https://www.getmonetizely.com/articles/financial-services-saas-pricing-in-2024-strategies-for-success), fintech companies typically use 3-4 pricing metrics. Our model uses:

| Metric | Description | Applies To |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Seat License** | Per-user access | All tiers |
| **Compute Usage** | Backtest hours, training time | Pro+ tiers |
| **Data Consumption** | API calls, historical data | Pro+ tiers |
| **AUM-Based** | Percentage of managed assets | Enterprise only |
