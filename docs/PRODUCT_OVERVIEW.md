# Product Overview: AI-Powered Quantitative Research Platform

*One-Pager for Startup Visa Applications & Investor Pitches*

---

## The Problem

**Algorithmic trading firms spend 6-12 months building infrastructure before deploying their first strategy.**

Current solutions are inadequate:

| Solution | Limitation |
|----------|------------|
| **QuantConnect** | Basic execution models, no risk-aware ML |
| **Alpaca** | Broker only, no intelligence |
| **In-house development** | €200K-500K cost, 12+ months |
| **Academic tools** | Not production-ready |

---

## Our Solution

**A platform that reduces trading infrastructure development from months to days, with built-in risk management unavailable elsewhere.**

### Core Innovation: Risk-Aware Execution

**Traditional ML**: Optimizes average returns → ignores catastrophic risks

**Our Approach**: Optimizes returns **while constraining worst-case losses**

```
We implement Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization:
Instead of: maximize E[Return]
We solve:   maximize E[Return] subject to CVaR₅%[Return] ≥ threshold
```

**Result**: Strategies that avoid large drawdowns, not just maximize gains.

**Academic basis**: Chow et al. (2015, JMLR), Dabney et al. (2018, AAAI)

## Current Phase: Validation

### Foundation Built — Now Testing with Customers

We have completed the technical foundation. Our focus now is **customer validation**, not feature expansion.

| Phase | Status | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|
| ~~Technical Development~~ | ✅ Complete | Core platform built |
| **Customer Discovery** | 🔄 Active | 20+ interviews planned |
| **Pilot Program** | 🔜 Q1 2025 | 3-5 European firms |
| Revenue Validation | Planned | Post-pilot |

### MVP Scope (What We're Launching)

| Feature | Status | Customer Value |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Crypto execution (Binance) | ✅ Ready | Days to go live |
| Risk-aware position sizing | ✅ Ready | Built-in compliance |
| CVaR optimization | ✅ Ready | Downside protection |
| Backtesting | ✅ Ready | Strategy validation |
| Real-time monitoring | ✅ Ready | Operational visibility |

### Deferred Features (Post-Validation)

| Feature | When | Trigger |
|---------|------|---------|
| US Equities | After EU validation | Customer demand |
| CME Futures | After 10 paying customers | Enterprise requests |
| Options | Based on pilot feedback | 3+ firm requests |

## Target Market: European Prop Trading Firms

### Why Europe First

| Factor | Europe | US |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Regulatory clarity | MiFID II framework | Fragmented |
| Competition | Lower density | Saturated |
| Market access | Startup visa pathway | Complex |
| Language | English common | English native |

### Target Customer

| Attribute | Profile |
|-----------|---------|
| **Company** | Proprietary trading firm |
| **Size** | 5-50 traders |
| **Location** | Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, France |
| **Need** | Fast infrastructure for new strategies |
| **Budget** | €2,000-5,000/month |

---

## Competitive Positioning

| Capability | Our Platform | QuantConnect | Alpaca |
|------------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| Risk-aware ML | **CVaR-constrained RL** | None | None |
| Execution modeling | **Multi-factor TCA** | Fixed spread | N/A |
| Time to market | **Days** | Weeks | N/A |
| Target customer | Institutional | Retail | Retail/SMB |

---

## Technical Foundation

Our technical depth is an **asset for fast iteration**, not a goal in itself.

| Asset | Benefit |
|-------|---------|
| Robust architecture | Rapid feature changes without breaking production |
| Extensive test coverage | Confidence to iterate quickly |
| Research-backed algorithms | Credibility with technical buyers |
| MiFID II alignment | Regulatory readiness for EU market |

*Technical depth enables customer focus, not delays it.*

## Intellectual Property

### Novel Algorithms

1. **CVaR-Constrained RL**: Risk-aware decision making
2. **Parametric TCA**: Market-adaptive cost modeling
3. **Twin Critics**: Reduced overestimation in value learning

### Academic Foundation

- Research-backed approach (Almgren-Chriss, Kyle, Dabney, Chow)
- Defensible through complexity and trade secrets

---

## Market Opportunity

**European algorithmic trading market**: Growing segment of €31B global market

**Our focus**: 500+ prop trading firms in EU seeking:
- Faster time-to-market
- Superior risk management
- Regulatory compliance (MiFID II)

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Pilot (Q1 2025)

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Cohort size | 3-5 firms |
| Duration | 3 months |
| Pricing | €500/month (discounted) |
| Commitment | Weekly feedback |

### Phase 2: Early Adopters (Q2-Q3 2025)

| Element | Target |
|---------|--------|
| Paying customers | 10+ firms |
| Price point | €2,000-3,000/month |
| ARR target | €200K+ |

### Phase 3: Scale (2026+)

- Expand feature set based on validated demand
- Geographic expansion within EU
- Enterprise tier development

---

## What We Will NOT Do (Until Validated)

- Add new asset classes without customer demand
- Build enterprise features before SMB validation
- Expand geographically before EU product-market fit
- Prioritize features over customer feedback
