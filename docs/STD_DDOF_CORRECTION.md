# Standard Deviation ddof Correction

## Summary

Fixed critical mathematical error in variance and standard deviation calculations by adding `ddof=1` (Bessel's correction) to all `np.std()` and `np.var()` calls. This ensures unbiased sample variance estimation across the codebase.

## Problem Description

### Mathematical Background

When estimating population variance from a sample, there are two formulas:

1. **Population variance (ddof=0)** - biased when used on samples:
   ```
   σ² = Σ(x - x̄)² / n
   ```

2. **Sample variance (ddof=1)** - unbiased estimator:
   ```
   s² = Σ(x - x̄)² / (n - 1)
   ```

The `n-1` denominator (Bessel's correction) accounts for the fact that we're using the sample mean rather than the true population mean, which introduces bias. Without this correction, variance is systematically underestimated.

### Why This Matters for RL

In reinforcement learning, we work with:
- **Batches of experiences** - samples from the full trajectory space
- **Rollout buffers** - samples from all possible episodes
- **Training batches** - samples from the dataset

All of these are **samples**, not complete populations, so `ddof=1` is statistically correct.

### Impact on Training

The systematic underestimation affects:

1. **Advantage Normalization** (MOST CRITICAL):
   - Advantages are normalized as: `(A - mean) / std`
   - Underestimated `std` → over-normalized advantages → larger policy gradients
   - This directly affects learning dynamics and convergence

2. **Logging Metrics**:
   - Reported standard deviations were systematically lower than true values
   - Affects monitoring and debugging

3. **Statistical Metrics**:
   - Variance calculations used in R² and other metrics were biased

### Magnitude of Error

| Batch Size | Systematic Error | Impact |
|------------|-----------------|---------|
| n=10       | ~5.4%          | Very significant |
| n=50       | ~2.0%          | Significant |
| n=100      | ~1.0%          | Moderate |
| n=1000     | ~0.1%          | Minor |

For typical RL batch sizes (50-256), the error is 1-2%, which is significant for gradient-based optimization.

   # After:
   var_true = float(np.var(true_vals, ddof=1))
   var_pred = float(np.var(pred_vals, ddof=1))
   ```

### Places Already Correct

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run the ddof correction tests
python3 tests/test_std_ddof_correction.py

# Or with pytest
pytest tests/test_std_ddof_correction.py -v
```

## Mathematical Verification

### Example: n=5 batch

```python
advantages = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mean = 3.0

# ddof=0: σ² = [(1-3)² + (2-3)² + (3-3)² + (4-3)² + (5-3)²] / 5
#           = [4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4] / 5 = 10/5 = 2.0
# std = sqrt(2.0) ≈ 1.414

# ddof=1: s² = 10 / 4 = 2.5
# std = sqrt(2.5) ≈ 1.581

# Ratio: 1.414 / 1.581 ≈ 0.894 (10.6% underestimate!)
```

### Impact on Normalized Advantages

```python
# With ddof=0:
normalized = (advantages - 3.0) / 1.414
# → [-1.414, -0.707, 0, 0.707, 1.414]

# With ddof=1 (correct):
normalized = (advantages - 3.0) / 1.581
# → [-1.265, -0.632, 0, 0.632, 1.265]

# The ddof=0 version has ~11% larger magnitude!
```

This directly affects the policy gradient magnitude and learning rate.

## Best Practices Going Forward

### When to Use ddof=1

✅ **Always use `ddof=1` when:**
- Computing statistics on a batch/sample
- Normalizing data (advantage, observations, etc.)
- Logging sample statistics
- Computing metrics on validation/test sets

### When to Use ddof=0

❌ **Rarely appropriate in RL, but could use when:**
- Computing statistics on a complete, known population (very rare)
- Implementing specific algorithms that explicitly use population variance
- Matching a reference implementation that uses ddof=0 (document why!)

### Code Review Checklist

When reviewing code with statistical calculations:

- [ ] All `np.std()` calls have `ddof=1` for samples
- [ ] All `np.var()` calls have `ddof=1` for samples
- [ ] Normalization uses unbiased std estimate
- [ ] Logged metrics use unbiased estimates
- [ ] Comments explain the choice of ddof

## Related Issues

This fix addresses the concerns raised about:
- Systematic bias in advantage normalization
- Inconsistent standard deviation estimates
- Logging metrics not reflecting true population statistics

## Migration Notes

### Expected Behavior Changes

After this fix, you may observe:

1. **Slightly different learning curves**: The corrected advantage normalization will produce slightly smaller normalized advantages (1-2% for typical batch sizes), affecting policy gradient magnitude.

2. **Higher logged std values**: All logged standard deviations will be slightly higher (now correct).

3. **More accurate monitoring**: Logged metrics now correctly estimate population statistics.

### Backward Compatibility

This is a **breaking change** in terms of exact numerical reproducibility:
- Models trained with the old code cannot be exactly reproduced
- However, the impact is small (1-2%) and the new version is mathematically correct
- New training runs will be more statistically sound

### Recommendations

- Retrain models to benefit from the correction
- Update baselines and benchmarks
- Review any hardcoded hyperparameters that may have compensated for the bias
