```

This runs a pre-configured momentum strategy on BTC/ETH historical data.

### Option B: Step-by-Step

#### 1. Check Available Presets

```bash
python scripts/quickstart.py list
```

**Output:**
```
Available Presets:
┌─────────────────┬─────────────┬───────────────────────┬────────────┐
│ Preset          │ Asset Class │ Strategy              │ Difficulty │
├─────────────────┼─────────────┼───────────────────────┼────────────┤
│ crypto_momentum │ Crypto Spot │ Momentum (BTC, ETH)   │ ⭐⭐       │
│ equity_swing    │ US Equity   │ Mean-Reversion        │ ⭐⭐       │
│ forex_carry     │ Forex OTC   │ Carry + Momentum      │ ⭐⭐⭐     │
│ crypto_perp     │ Futures     │ Funding Arbitrage     │ ⭐⭐⭐⭐   │
│ cme_index       │ CME Futures │ Index Momentum        │ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ │
└─────────────────┴─────────────┴───────────────────────┴────────────┘
```

#### 2. Get Preset Info

```bash
python scripts/quickstart.py info crypto_momentum
```

**Output:**
```

## Understanding Results

### Key Metrics Explained

| Metric | What It Means | Typical Range* |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Total Return** | Overall profit/loss | Varies by strategy |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | Risk-adjusted return | 0.5-2.5 |
| **Max Drawdown** | Largest peak-to-trough drop | -5% to -50% |
| **Win Rate** | % of profitable trades | 40%-70% |
| **Profit Factor** | Gross profit / Gross loss | 1.0-3.0 |

*Typical ranges are for illustration only. Actual results will vary significantly based on market conditions, strategy parameters, and time period.

### Interpreting Backtest Results

**Important Considerations:**

1. **Backtests are hypothetical** - They use historical data and cannot predict future performance
2. **Overfitting risk** - Strong backtest results may not translate to live trading
3. **Transaction costs** - Ensure realistic fees and slippage are included
4. **Market regime** - Strategies that worked in past conditions may fail in new environments

## Training Your First Model

### Why Train?

Pre-built strategies use fixed rules. Training creates an ML model that:
- Adapts to changing market conditions
- Learns optimal position sizing
- Discovers patterns in data

> **Note**: ML models are tools, not guarantees. A trained model may underperform simple strategies depending on market conditions.

### Step 1: Prepare Training Data

Data is automatically downloaded for quick start presets. For custom data:

```bash
# Crypto
python scripts/fetch_binance_filters.py --universe

# Stocks
python scripts/download_stock_data.py --symbols AAPL MSFT GOOGL --start 2020-01-01
```

### Step 2: Start Training

```bash
python scripts/quickstart.py train crypto_momentum
```

**Example output (hypothetical):**
```
Starting training...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Episode 100/1000  │████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░│ 10%
  Avg Reward: 0.42
  Sharpe: 1.23
  Loss: 0.0234

Episode 200/1000  │████████░░░░░░░░░░░░│ 20%
  Avg Reward: 0.58
  Sharpe: 1.45
  Loss: 0.0189

... (training continues) ...

Training complete!
Model saved to: models/crypto_momentum_v1.pt

Note: Training metrics are internal measurements.
Out-of-sample validation is required before any live deployment.
```

### Step 3: Backtest Trained Model

```bash
python script_backtest.py --config configs/config_sim.yaml --model models/crypto_momentum_v1.pt
```

### Training Tips

| Tip | Explanation |
|-----|-------------|
| **Start simple** | Use default settings first |
| **Monitor overfitting** | Watch for validation divergence |
| **Save checkpoints** | Training auto-saves every 100 episodes |
| **Use GPU** | 5-10x faster with CUDA |

## Going Live

### ⚠️ Critical Warning

**Live trading involves real financial risk.** Before proceeding:

1. **Paper trade extensively** - Test with simulated money for weeks or months
2. **Understand the risks** - You can lose your entire investment
3. **Start very small** - Use minimum position sizes initially
4. **Never invest more than you can afford to lose**
5. **This is not investment advice** - You are solely responsible for your trading decisions

### Prerequisites

1. **Exchange Account**
   - Binance (crypto)
   - Alpaca (stocks)
   - OANDA (forex)
   - Interactive Brokers (futures/options)

2. **API Keys**
   - Generate API keys from your exchange
   - Store securely (never commit to git!)
   - Use IP whitelisting where available

### Step 1: Configure API Keys

Create `.env` file (never commit this!):

```bash
# Crypto (Binance)
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_key_here
BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_secret_here

# Stocks (Alpaca)
ALPACA_API_KEY=your_key_here
ALPACA_API_SECRET=your_secret_here

# Forex (OANDA)
OANDA_API_KEY=your_key_here
OANDA_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
```

### Step 2: Paper Trading (Required First Step)

**Always test with paper trading before using real money:**

```bash
# Crypto (Binance Testnet)
python script_live.py --config configs/config_live.yaml --paper

# Stocks (Alpaca Paper)
python script_live.py --config configs/config_live_alpaca.yaml --paper
```

**Recommended paper trading period:** Minimum 4-8 weeks to observe strategy behavior across different market conditions.

### Step 3: Live Trading

**Only proceed after extensive paper trading and thorough risk assessment.**

```bash
# Crypto
python script_live.py --config configs/config_live.yaml

# Stocks
python script_live.py --config configs/config_live_alpaca.yaml --live
```

### Safety Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Kill Switch** | Emergency stop via `services/ops_kill_switch.py` |
| **Position Limits** | Max position per symbol and total |
| **Drawdown Guard** | Auto-stop if drawdown exceeds limit |
| **Error Throttling** | Pause on repeated errors |

**Configure risk limits in `configs/risk.yaml` before going live.**

## Next Steps

### Level 1: Customize Strategies

1. Modify parameters in preset configs:
   ```yaml
   # configs/quickstart/crypto_momentum.yaml
   strategy:
     lookback_period: 20  # Try 10, 30, 50
     entry_threshold: 0.02  # Try 0.01, 0.03
   ```

2. Run backtest with modified config:
   ```bash
   python script_backtest.py --config configs/quickstart/crypto_momentum.yaml
   ```

### Level 2: Create Custom Strategies

1. Create strategy file:
   ```python
   # strategies/my_strategy.py
   from strategies.base import BaseStrategy

   class MyStrategy(BaseStrategy):
       def generate_signal(self, data):
           # Your logic here
           return signal
   ```

2. Register in config and run

### Level 3: Advanced Training

1. Try different asset classes
2. Experiment with PBT (Population-Based Training)
3. Add adversarial training for robustness

### Level 4: Multi-Asset Portfolio

1. Combine multiple strategies
2. Implement portfolio-level risk management
3. Cross-asset correlation analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "ModuleNotFoundError"

```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### "Data not found"

```bash
# Download required data
python scripts/quickstart.py check crypto_momentum
# Follow any missing data instructions
```

#### "API connection failed"

1. Check API keys in `.env`
2. Verify exchange status
3. Check network connection
4. For Binance: ensure IP is whitelisted

#### "Out of memory"

```yaml
# Reduce batch size in config
training:
  batch_size: 32  # Reduce from 64
  n_envs: 2       # Reduce from 4
```

## Risk Disclaimers

### Risk of Loss

**Trading in financial instruments carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors.** The high degree of leverage available in forex, futures, and crypto markets can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to trade, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite.

**There is a possibility that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment** and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.

### Hypothetical Performance

**All backtest results and performance figures in this documentation are hypothetical** and are presented for illustration purposes only. They do not represent actual trading results. Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, including:

1. **Hindsight bias** - Strategies are designed with the benefit of hindsight
2. **No slippage guarantee** - Actual execution prices may differ significantly
3. **No emotional factor** - Simulations don't account for psychological impacts on trading decisions
4. **Market conditions change** - Past market conditions may not repeat
