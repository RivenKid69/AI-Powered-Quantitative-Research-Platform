"""
Adversarial Training Module for Robust Reinforcement Learning

This package implements adversarial training techniques for robust RL:
- State perturbation attacks (PGD, FGSM)
- State-Adversarial PPO (SA-PPO)
- Population-Based Training (PBT) scheduler

Based on research:
- "Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning against Adversarial Perturbations on State Observations" (NeurIPS 2020)
- "Population Based Training of Neural Networks" (DeepMind 2017)
