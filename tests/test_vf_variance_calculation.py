"""
Test distributional VF clipping variance calculation correctness.

This test validates that old_variance is computed from OLD distributions
(stored in rollout buffer), not from current predictions.

The bug was:
- Quantile critic: Used current quantiles instead of old quantiles from buffer
- Categorical critic: Used uniform distribution assumption instead of old probs

The fix:
- Store old_quantiles and old_probs in rollout buffer
- Compute old_variance from these stored distributions
