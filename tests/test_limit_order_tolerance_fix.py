"""Tests for limit order price tolerance fix (2025-11-26).

Bug Description:
    The fixed tolerance of 1e-12 for limit order fill comparisons was smaller
    than floating-point machine epsilon for high-value assets (e.g., BTC at $100,000).
    This caused legitimate maker fills to be rejected due to floating-point
    representation errors.

Fix:
    Replaced fixed absolute tolerance with relative tolerance that scales
    with price magnitude: tolerance = max(rel_tol * max_price, abs_tol)

Reference:
    - IEEE 754 double precision: ~15-16 significant digits
    - Machine epsilon: ~2.22e-16
    - At price $100,000: epsilon * price ~ 2.2e-11 (larger than 1e-12!)
