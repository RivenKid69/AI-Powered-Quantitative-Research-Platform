"""
Test for quantile loss formula fix.

Verifies that the default behavior uses the CORRECT formula from Dabney et al. 2018:
    delta = T - Q  (target - predicted)
    ρ_τ(u) = |τ - I{u < 0}| · L_κ(u)

This ensures proper asymmetric penalties:
- Underestimation (Q < T): penalty τ
- Overestimation (Q ≥ T): penalty (1 - τ)
