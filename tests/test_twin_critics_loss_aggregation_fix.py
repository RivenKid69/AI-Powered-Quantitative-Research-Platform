"""
Comprehensive tests for Twin Critics Loss Aggregation Fix (2025-11-24).

Tests that the fix correctly applies max() to each critic independently
before averaging, instead of averaging before max() (which was the bug).

Bug Report:
- Location: distributional_ppo.py lines 10713-10720, 11146-11151
- Impact: 25% underestimation in mixed clipping cases
- Fix: Apply max(c1_uc, c1_c) and max(c2_uc, c2_c) independently, then average

Test Coverage:
1. Basic correctness - mathematical verification
2. Edge cases - uniform clipping, mixed clipping
3. Integration - with actual DistributionalPPO components
4. Regression - ensure existing tests still pass
