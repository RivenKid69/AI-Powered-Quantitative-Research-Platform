"""
Test VF clipping fix: ensure targets are NOT clipped, only predictions.

This test validates the critical fix where Value Function clipping was
incorrectly applied to targets instead of predictions. According to PPO
paper (Schulman et al. 2017), the correct formula is:

L^CLIP_VF = max( (V(s) - V_targ)^2, (clip(V(s), V_old±eps) - V_targ)^2 )

Where:
- V(s) is the current prediction (should be clipped)
- V_targ is the target GAE return (must remain unchanged)
